An empty file means heartbeat API calls are skipped.\n7. `BOOTSTRAP.md`: Used during the first session to help define the assistant's identity and set up connections with the user (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.). Once completed, this file should be deleted.\n\nThese files provide context and guidance for the assistant, ensuring it behaves consistently and appropriately across sessions.
